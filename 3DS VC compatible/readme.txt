This requires you to have at least a CFW allowing unsigned software running on your 3DS system!

It is using virtuaNES injection method, all other methods didn't work, so it's just this one...

If you want to challenge yourself, you can try the regular 1.3, RTA is made to have the levels viable for savestateless playthroughs. Good luck!
