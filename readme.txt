For legal reasons, I will not host the roms, you need to find the original SMB1 rom yourself, shouldnt be hard to find (despite Nintendo's efforts with taking sites down)

This page only exists to preserve older versions of the same romhack, in case RHDN dies.

I recommend to use floating ips, as it supports bps, the better patch format, but it also supports old .ips
