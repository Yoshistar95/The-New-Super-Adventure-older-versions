For legal reasons, I will not host the roms, you need to find the original SMB1 rom yourself, shouldnt be hard to find (despite Nintendo's efforts with taking sites down)

This page only exists to preserve older versions of the same romhack, plus Github host is better than RHDN.

I recommend to use floating ips, as it supports bps, the better patch format, but it also supports old .ips

If you downloaded 1.2 from RHDN, then I'm sorry, but it's impossible due to a stupid oversight.
A trampoline in 6-2 was for some reason moved one tile to the left, making the jump impossible to reach the floating island.
1.2 hosted here is the hotfix one, I don't recommend trying to beat the game on older versions, but have fun playing the buggy versions :)
